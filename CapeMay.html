	<h2>Visit Old Victorian Cape May</h2>
	
	<p>
	The many attractions of Cape May were largely discovered by the wealthy 
during the 18th and 19th 
centuries when it was a fashionable resort town. It was so popular 
that six US Presidents had summer homes here.

Tourists today are attracted by the endless fine beaches, the beautiful Cape May 
Point Lighthouse, and the many handsome Victorian-style holiday homes.

Located in Cape May is the Emlen Physick Estate, an
 18-room mansion built in 1879 which is a great example of the American Stick Style
 of architecture. Also of interest is the Yankee, an 80-foot-tall schooner offering a 
variety of harbor tours and dolphin/whale-sighting cruises.
