	<h2>Liberty State Park Offers Unparalleled Views of Manhattan's Skyline</h2>
	
	<p>
	Overlooking the Upper New York Bay, Liberty Island, and Ellis Island, 
Liberty State Park encompasses 1,212 waterside acres.
 In addition to its wonderful views, the park contains 
 Communipaw Cove, a 36-acre tidal salt marsh that has 
been designated as a nature preserve.

The park is also home to a number of interesting memorials and monuments such as 

 a dedication to the Holocaust, and a 
memorial consisting with the names of the victims who died
on 9/11 with ties to New Jersey.

The park also has recreational facilities, from picnic areas to fishing, kayaking, 
and cycling. Be sure to allocate some time to visit the park's Interpretive Center 
which provides information related to the ecology and history of New Jersey.
