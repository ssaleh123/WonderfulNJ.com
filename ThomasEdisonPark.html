	<h2>Where Modern America Was Invented</h2>
	
	<p>
	A must-see when visiting New Jersey is the former home and laboratory of Thomas 
Edison. This is where breakthroughs such as movie cameras, sound 
recordings, and batteries first saw the light of day.

The visit includes a close-up look at labs, vintage movies, original 
artifacts, and a chance to tour Thomas Edison's magnificent home.

Thomas Edisonâ€™s home and laboratory are a step back in time, when machines were run 
by belts and pulleys and music was played on phonographs. 
The Edison laboratories operated for more than 40 years.
