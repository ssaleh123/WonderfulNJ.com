	<h2>Take a Stroll Along Atlantic City's Famous Boardwalk</h2>
	
	<p>
	One of the most popular coastal resort towns on the northeastern coast of the United States, Atlantic City is best known for its famous Boardwalk. 
This four-mile-long promenade was constructed in 1870 and to this day remains the place where the majority of the city's sightseeing opportunities are found.
Among its most popular tourist spots is the iconic Steel Pier. This carnival-style amusement park has rides for all ages, 
including a massive observation wheel that gives riders amazing views over the city and ocean. 
In addition, bike rentals, the historic electric tram, or traditional rickshaw-like rolling chairs make a fun alternative to walking the boardwalk.
